Please consider to cite one or more of the following papers, if you use CAL in
some your work.

Preliminary Papers
========================

The breadth-first algorithms of CAL took multiple iterations to design such that
they are usable in practice. Hence, these two publications should also be cited
when citing CAL.

- Hiroyuki Ochi, Koichi Yasuoka, and Shuzo Yajima
  “[*Breadth-first manipulation of very large binary-decision diagrams*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/580030)”.
  In: *International Conference on Computer Aided Design* (ICCAD). (1993)
  ```bibtex

             and Yajima, Shuzo},

  }

Original CAL Papers
========================

The following two papers on the specific breadth-first BDD manipulation in CAL
have been published. If you use variable reordering, the second is worth
citation. Otherwise, only cite the first.

- Jagesh V. Sanghavi, Rajeev K. Ranjan, Robert K. Brayton, and Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.
  “[*High Performance BDD Package by Exploiting Memory Hierarchy*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/545652)”.
  In: *33rd Design Automation Conference* (DAC). (1996)
  ```bibtex

             and Ranjan, Rajeev K.

             and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Alberto},
    title     = {High Performance {BDD} Package by Exploiting Memory Hierarchy},
    year      = 1996,
